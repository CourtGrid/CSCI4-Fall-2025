#Array/List Notes!
#Went to the array, and now I’m going to list cause it feels like I should understand lists before the arrays.

#I wrote down list(abc), forgot to put it in quotations and rewrote it as list(‘abc’). Just experimenting, just to see what happened. Nothing happened, 
#so I thought I would try to print the list. That ended up printing <class ‘list’>.

#Okay just realized I have to do the = sign if I want it to print. (completely forgot). I shall test it out again with ‘abc’ in a moment, 
#however I got distracted because I scrolled down and saw list(range(10)) and decided I wanted to try that out. 

#Just tried it out, it did exactly what it was supposed to do, which is print ‘abc’ out as [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’]
#Wow Wait just realized that when I looked at the range list examples that when you put down ‘10’, it actually only lists up to 9 which is fun.

#Wait, I think I understand how this works. I THINK it starts counting at 0, but the computer is just treating the ‘0’ like we would a 1, 
#so once it gets up to 9 the computer has counted 10 integers. I’m going to test stuff out. 

#Just realized I can attach any name I want to the list. 

#Got distracted with the integers just realized how that works (mainly because I forgot to write the 5 inside the paranthesis).

#Just now realizing range was part of something else…oops :>

#Saw the part under lists about sorting, and saw that they had a bit of a tutorial so I figured I would try it out. I found that when I want to sort out a list numerically, 
#all I have to do is type out list.sort(). This is (I’m pretty sure) just because there aren’t any specifications that I added in, so it automatically lists it numerically. 
#I don’t know if it does the same alphabetically. I’m going to test that.

#It DOES list it out alphabetically :D

#I think the arrays confuse me a tad bit…

#Okay so here is what I think I’ve done wrong so far:
#- I’ve been associating arrays as if they work with lists, but I don’t think that’s the case.
#-There is probably something I’m not typing out right

#I have forgotten to explain what an array and list is, that is my bad I got excited.

#Lists are sequences used to store collections of homogeneous items.

#An array is similar to a list, but the type of objects that are stored in them is constrained.
#An array stores a bunch of similar objects in a structured format.

#Arrays and Lists are different to collections because they are structured/organized in a more particular manner than a collection is.

#A collection is a group of organized objects, or variables, or nothing, that are organized in some manner. 
#A collection doesn't have to organized in a meaningful way, it can be done randomly.

#Note to self: dissect the frog

#Arrays allow you to structure data of any type, allow for portability, and allow for creation of functions. 
#This is me making an assumption, but I believe that you create the functions so that data can be transfferred between two different programs or programming languages? Maybe?

#Functions outputs cannot be ambiguous. (fancy f hehe :3)
#Functions create mappings between two sets. 
#Functions only take particular types of things. The object type is specific. 
#Functions have an input and an output.
